# Serie-Bot
A Discord bot for my server. Do stuff with the source if you want I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


To use it, rename `config.yml.example` to `config.yml` and add the required information.

If you want to use the `furry` and `eevee` commands you need to add your own folder of images in `images/furries` and `images/evee`. These are not provided for you.

Most of the code is specific to it's original server so don't expect it to work perfectly.

Enjoy~
