# Serie-Bot
A Discord bot for my server. Do stuff with the source if you want I guess ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯<br />

You can invite the Public Bot with this link -> https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=200478269403955211&scope=bot<br />

Or host it yourself, as explained below:

To use it, rename `config.yml.example` to `config.yml` and add the required information.

If you want to use the `furry` and `eevee` commands you need to add your own folder of images in `images/furries` and `images/evee`. These are not provided for you.

Some features may not work exactly as expected due to this bot being used on one account and throw onto git.
# Requirements
- Ruby
- bundler (`gem install bundler`)

# Install
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Seriell/Serie-Bot.git`
2. cd into the repo: `cd Serie-Bot`
3. Edit `config.rb.example` to include the needed information and save it as `config.rb`
4. Install bundler if you haven't already: `gem install bundler`
5. Install the bundle: `bundle install`
6. Run the bot: `bundle exec ruby run.rb`. If on Windows you can just double click `run_windows.bat`

Please report any issues to `@Seriel#0757` | `<@228574821590499329>` on Discord.
