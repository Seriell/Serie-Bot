# Serie-Bot
A Discord bot for my server. Do stuff with the source if you want I guess ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯<br />

You can invite the Public Bot with this link -> http://bot.seriel.pw <br />
The Public Bot might not always be online, if you want the bot all the time for sure, please host it yourself.

# Self-Hosting:

To use it, rename `config.rb.example` to `config.rb` and add the required information.

Some features may not work exactly as expected, but with time it will get better!
# Requirements
- Ruby
- bundler (`gem install bundler`)

# Install
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Seriell/Serie-Bot.git`
2. cd into the repo: `cd Serie-Bot`
3. Edit `config.rb.example` to include the needed information and save it as `config.rb`
4. Install bundler if you haven't already: `gem install bundler`
5. Install the bundle: `bundle install`
6. Run the bot. For Linux: `./run_linux.sh`. For Windows: `run_windows.bat`.

# Updating
